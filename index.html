    <h2>About</h2>
    
    <p>Hi everyone! I'm krosisbh, and this is my personal website where I will post varying stuff just to get stuff out.</p>
    <p>I am a graduate student in physics who enjoys personal programming on the side, and I am aiming to do computational physics as a career path. If the font or color scheme of this website doesn't give it away, I am also a Linux daily driver (Debian 12). Stuff related to this will be in <a href="stem_stuff.html">stem_stuff</a>.</p>
    <p>Like most people these days, I enjoy video games, but while I play a wide variety of games, I enjoy rambling about the relatively niche genres of rhythm games and shoot 'em ups. You can find stuff about that in <a href="game_stuff.html">game_stuff</a>.</p>
    <p>Finally, I particularly enjoy language learning, not just programming langauges, but human languages. While I can only confidentally say I am fluent in English, I am very solid at Japanese, and am able to ask for directions in German. However, I do want to learn as many languages as possible in my lifetime. Stuff related to this will be in <a href="language_stuff.html">language_stuff</a>.</p>
    <p>Miscellaious stuff will be in <a href="other_stuff.html">other_stuff</a>.</p>
    <p> The font of this website is Iosevka, and the color scheme is based off Kanagawa. This website tries to be as plain html and css as possible, but I am using MathJax so I can render equations. \(  \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}\)</p>
