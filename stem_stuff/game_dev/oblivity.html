    <h2>Random 3D RPG Idea</h2>
    <h2>2024-01-23</h2>

    <p>This is the first devlog of a game I decided to work on. I am mostly inspired by The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivon, and Divinity: Original Sin 2.
    Now this isn't one of those newbie projects where I think me, a single person, is going to create a AAA 3D open-world RPG, but a lot of inspiration is going to be pulled from these games.</p>
</p>
    <p>

        From Oblivion, I really would like to mimic:
        <ul>
            <item>
                The clunky first person combat. 
            </item>
            <item>
                The scuffed dialogue
            </item>
        </ul>
        These may seem like some of the worse parts about Oblivion, but I am very fond of it.

        From Divinity, I really would like to mimic:

        <ul>
            <item>The style of open-world it is. What I would make it not as expansive and instricit as Dinvity's world, but I really enjoy the
                idea of instead of having a singular giant world, the game is split into chapters, each with a smaller open-world setting. You
                can still explore freely but you're limited to a certain set of quests at the time. I think as a solo dev, that would be fesible.
                At my sacle, this would mean me maybe making singular towns as playable areas and you're limited to that town until you progress.
            </item>
        </ul>

        Both of these games also does not try to take itself so serious, which is something I am a huge fan of.


        <h3>My Scope</h3>

        <p>
            I want to make a semi-open-world RPG, so how big? Well, small enough so that a single dev can do it in a lifetime, of course.
            An achievable scope would be a handful of towns and immediate surrondings, say 1-5 towns, and 10-20 quests from each area on the higher end.
            
        </p>

        <p>I feel like that could be doable.</p>

        <h3>Workflow</h3>
        <p>
        I am using Godot for my game engine. This 100% would not be feasible if I had to ship my own engine. I plan to use Rust through GDExt
        to implement some of the bigger systems. This is not because I am worried about performance. The main idea is I just feel more comfortable
        with one of my lower level languages with strict typing. That's it. Why Rust over C++? The simple reason is cargo is such a nice build system 
        to work with and I don't want to spend awhile getting a C++ build system working.</p>

        <p>
            For assets I plan to use Blender. I am not the greatest 3D modeller but I find it fun. For textures I will use GIMP, but I have
            a pretty bad habit of trying to generate texture through shaders instead of making them myself, but we'll see.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>
            If I begin to make progress, I'll post it here. I'm not sure if I will follow through completely but I'd like to atleast make a small demo.
            Making a 3D RPG seems really rewarding and fun in that regard.
